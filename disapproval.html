<p><strong>Int. kitchen — morning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong> is sitting at a table, drinking a coffee. <strong>Tom</strong> enters.</p>

<p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
  You look tired. Oh Christ, you were up all night studying again weren’t you?
</p>
<p><strong>Tom<span>: </span></strong>
  Yeah? So what?
</p>
<p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
  Tom, I think maybe it’s time you gave this whole thing up.
</p>
<p><strong>Tom<span>: </span></strong>
  But Mum.
</p>
<p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
  I just want what’s best for you Tom. And I just think, in the current...economic climate. You should consider becoming a dancer or a comedian.
</p>
<p><strong>Tom<span>: </span></strong>
  But Mum...
</p>
<p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
  Instead of staying up all night reading all that useless caselaw, maybe you should stay up all night taking acid and writing jokes about The Avalanches’ new album.

<p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
  Look at your cousin. He went into comedy, and now he’s still single and very critical of his life choices. He’s an absolute wreck! Wouldn’t you like that? I mean, how many Lawyers do you know that actually make it.

<p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
  I just don’t think you’re the next Chief Justice Kiefal AC. And there’s no shame in that. Just do comedy for a year. You can still do law on the side! Volunteer at legal aid on weekends!
