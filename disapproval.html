  <p><em>A morning conversation with my Mother. Int. Kitchen.</em></p>
  <p>Mum: You look tired. Oh Christ, you were up all night studying again weren’t you?</p>
  <p>Me: Yeah? So what?</p>
  <p>Mum: Tom, I think maybe it’s time you gave this whole thing up.</p>
  <p>Me: But Mum.</p>
  <p>Mum: I just want what’s best for you Tom. And I just think, in the current...economic climate. You should consider becoming a dancer or a comedian.</p>
  <p>Me: But Mum…</p>
  <p>Mum: Instead of staying up all night reading all that useless caselaw, maybe you should stay up all night taking acid and writing jokes about The Avalanches’ new album.</p>
  <p>Me: …</p>
  <p>Mum: Look at your cousin. He went into comedy, and now he’s still single and very critical of his life choices. He’s an absolute wreck! Wouldn’t you like that? I mean, how many Lawyers do you know that actually make it.</p>
  <p>Me: …</p>
  <p>Mum: I just don’t think you’re the next Chief Justice Kiefal AC. And there’s no shame in that. Just do comedy for a year. You can still do law on the side! Volunteer at legal aid on weekends!</p>
