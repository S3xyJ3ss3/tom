  <h1>Tom Glassey</h1> 
  <p><a href="db-cooper.jpg" class="image floater">To whom it may concern,</a></p> 
  <p>If you are reading this maybe you have googled my name, maybe you are the recipient of a mass-email, or probably you are my mum.</p> 
  <p>If you are considering me for a role in business development, trust account management, or legal administrative/<wbr>advocacy work and have taken a wrong turn from my LinkedIn page, please do not continue reading under any circumstance, and instead follow this <a href="resume.pdf">link to my résumé</a>.</p>
  <p>If I have applied for a role I am grossly under-qualified for, and am idealistically trying to pigeonhole my just barely relevant experience into the prescribed required skillset please read on.</p>
  <p>First and foremost, I feel compelled to justify my lack of tangible creative experience, as I am hoping to assume some sort of writing or producing position? Despite my <a href="parents-disapproval.html">parent’s disapproval</a>, I chose to study law, and have done so for the last three years and have worked in legal positions for four. I have spent two years as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentured_servitude">Legal Clerk</a>, two years working with the Director of Public Prosecutions Office, and now employed in a private firm as a <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/snake-oil-salesman">Business Development Manager</a>. While I lack creative experience, I do have <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6ltWsRc.gif"><em>life</em> experience</a>.</p>
  <p>In saying that, I do have some creative merit. I topped Drama and English in high school, and was the <a href="cultural-captain.jpg">Cultural Captain</a> of my college…</p>
  <p>But wait there’s more.</p>
  <p>In my senior year, I was the Queensland Theatre Company 2014 Playwright of the Year, for my play <em>Substance</em>. That same year I starred as Tom in an Empire Theatre production of <em>Away</em>, received favorable reviews, and was required to do three whole push-ups on stage (an ability I retain both on and off stage). In high school I was bullied, and also state finalist in the Raw <a href="comedy.html">Comedy</a> Competition. The following year, <a href="#">my short story ‘Vanity Plates’</a> was published in the 100th issue of <em>Voiceworks</em>.</p>
  <p>My latest venture, beyond <a href="#">a one man show about <em>Cats</em> the musical</a>, which I am yet to find an audience for, and a screenplay for a spy-comedy,  is an audio experience called <em>A Neutral Experience</em>. Inspired by Chris Morris’ <em>Blue Jam</em>, I aimed to curate an ambient comedy experience, through music and alternative skit writing. I produced, wrote, mixed the entire project and provided some voice work. </p>
  <p>Beyond the above, I am generally useful to have around and I possess what I would describe as the millennial skill set. Through my role in Business Development I have experience as a SEO copywriter, podcast producer, social media manager, and digital marketer. I am <a href="#">familiar with photoshop</a> and have very basic HTML knowledge, having <a href="#">created the following sites</a>. Most importantly, I <a href="#">can write listicles</a>.</p>
  <p>Finally, here are some of my favourite things. If you too like these things, perhaps we’re not so different you and I. Perhaps we are so alike, that by helping me, you’d be helping yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">role models</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="#">favourite songs</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="#">favourite movies</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="#">favourite cocktail</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="#">favourite Italian restaurant</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="#">favourite books</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="#">favourite skits</a>; and</li>
    <li><a href="#">well-shaped faces</a>.</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>In my spare time I <a href="#">ride my bike</a> and <a href="#">I box</a>. I also volunteer at a radio station, where I read for the blind.</p>
  <p>Here are <a href="#">my impressions</a>.</p>
  <p>Here is a <a href="#">picture of me climbing a tree</a>.</p>
  <p>Ideally, I would hope I can be considered as pragmatic, shaped by my career in the emotionally demanding and competitive legal world, with enough eclectic creative experience to attest my ability as a content creator and manager. And if you got a tree that needs climbing, I’m your man.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
