# ideas
different colours for different types of links?
still not sure how to handle list

# changes to text
link names and accessibility:
- link text should make sense on its own
- obviously not to the extent of ruining the jokes: only where it's possible

# hosting
suggest github.io
- completely free
- don't have to worry about servers
- can point to a custom domain
- you will be able to edit BUT
  - you will need to learn the basics of git BUT
    - this is a great excuse to learn git which is super valuable

# links
types
- internal
  - image
  - text
- external e.g. wikipedia

## for different users
no javascript e.g. lynx
- all just working links to different pages 

desktop
- images open on hover at mouse position
- short text e.g. 'parents disapproval' opens similarly
- long text e.g. 'cats' opens on new page

mobile
- images fill screen with darkened border on tap
- tapping border closes them
- text opens another window/tab?
