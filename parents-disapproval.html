  <p class="scene"><strong>Mother</strong> is sitting at a table, drinking a coffee. <strong>Tom</strong> enters.</p>
  <p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
    You look tired. Oh Christ, you were up all night studying again weren’t you?
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tom<span>: </span></strong>
    Yeah? So what?
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
    Tom, I think maybe it’s time you gave this whole thing up.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tom<span>: </span></strong>
    But Mum.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
    I just want what’s best for you Tom. And I just think, in the current...economic climate. You should consider becoming a dancer or a comedian.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tom<span>: </span></strong>
    But Mum...
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
    Instead of staying up all night reading all that useless caselaw, maybe you should stay up all night taking acid and writing jokes about The Avalanches’ new album.

  <p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
    Look at your cousin. He went into comedy, and now he’s still single and very critical of his life choices. He’s an absolute wreck! Wouldn’t you like that? I mean, how many Lawyers do you know that actually make it.

  <p><strong>Mother<span>: </span></strong>
    I just don’t think you’re the next Chief Justice Kiefal AC. And there’s no shame in that. Just do comedy for a year. You can still do law on the side! Volunteer at legal aid on weekends!
